## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a fourth-year Digital Game Design student at Beykoz University with a long-standing passion for game development, which began in high school. Over the past two years, I have collaborated with my friends to develop web games, gaining experience on both large and small projects. I have actively participated in numerous game jams, enhancing my time management skills and ability to work effectively in teams. With five years of experience using Unity, I am continually improving my skills in object-oriented programming, SOLID principles, and design patterns.
